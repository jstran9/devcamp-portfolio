<!--- Old README contents will be removed from being displayed.
- Creating this repository to follow along the contents of Jordan Hudgen's course, Professional-rails-5-development-course
on Udemy.
    - The course is here, https://www.udemy.com/professional-rails-5-development-course/

* Ruby version
    - I am using ruby 2.3.1 for this.

* System dependencies
    - I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit.

* Database creation
    - This Rails app uses the rails db:create command to generate both a development and test PostgreSQL database.

* Database initialization
    - Data initialized will have to be done via the db/seeds.rb file. At this point data has not been bootstrapped yet.

* How to run the test suite
    - Although not ideal, this course does not focus on using tests and used the -T flag to ignore creating tests.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
    - For now this is not applicable.

* Deployment instructions
    - Later on this will be deployed to Heroku, for now this repo does not deploy to a remote web server.
