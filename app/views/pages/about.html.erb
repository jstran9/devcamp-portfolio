<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently interested in learning web development. I have built my own smaller scale websites using other
  programming languages and technologies such as Java, Spring, Python, and Django. Currently I am learning Ruby and Ruby
  on Rails (RoR) 5 (this website is built using Ruby and RoR 5). I am open to learning any programming languages as I
  have prior internship experience where I developed using C++ (back-end development) and Objective-C
  (mobile development). I am taking a variety of online courses to further my exposure to different programming
  languages and to gain more software development skills.
</p>
<p>As I attempt to further gain my software development skills, I am also exposing myself to using testing frameworks
  such as: JUnit (with Java), Unittest (Python/Django), Capybara (Ruby), Poltergeist (Ruby), and RSpec (Ruby).
